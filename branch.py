Variation 1 branch is like a feature branch which also contains
the same files as the main branch. 

If satisfied, you can merge it back into the main branch

Recall: 
-- git branch -a : to see all branches and which branch you are on --
1. git branch <branch-name> : makes the branch
2. git checkout <branch-name> : move to that branch 
(shortcut: git chekout -b <branch-name>)
3. git add . 
4. git commit -m "..."
5. git push (as a separate branch)
-- git branch -D <branch name>: to delete unmerged branch --
